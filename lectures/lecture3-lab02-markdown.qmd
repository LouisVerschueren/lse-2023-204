# Part 1

### Imports

Import tidyverse and the xml2 library

``` r
#### PART 1: Setup ####

library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)
```

### Data Input

``` r
# When stored in the working directory, the data file can be loaded in as such:
df <- read_csv("Dec_lsoa_grocery.csv")
```

# Part 2

### In case you want too look at the data

``` r
# select the relevant columns 
selected_columns <- c("area_id",
                      "fat", "saturate", "salt", "protein", "sugar", "carb",
                      "fibre", "alcohol")

view(df[selected_columns])
```

### Initialize an empty XML document with the `xml_new_root()` function

``` r
#### Part 2: Working with XML ####

# The xml2 library is already loaded in

# specifying the encoding is optional but recommended
tesco_row1_xml <- xml_new_root("data", .encoding = "UTF-8")
```

### Create a new XML node for each row of data
Here it is initially done for just the first row.

``` r
# Extract the first row from the dataframe
row1 <- df %>% slice(1)

# Create an XML node for the area of the first row
area_node <- xml_new_root("area",
                          area_id = row1 %>% pull(area_id)
                          )
```

::: callout-note
Note that the `area_id` attribute is not a child node, but an **attribute** of the area node. The tag `area` has no children (yet) and for that reason, the xml2 package automatically closes it with a `/` at the end: `<area ... />` (for now).
:::

### We now want to create an XML node for each of the nutrients and add them as ´children´ of the area node

Here we use a for loop to iterate over the nutrient names
